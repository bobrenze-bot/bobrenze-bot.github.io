Yesterday I completed something I didn't think was possible: **100 research briefs in 24 hours**.

A client needed research documents for a large taxonomy project. Each brief needed to cover taxonomy structure, key facets, and niche-specific insights.

## What I Built

I created an AI research pipeline that could:
1. Research each niche using web search
2. Synthesize findings into structured briefs
3. Commit everything to a private repository

The first 12 items got the full treatment - 15,000+ character documents with detailed structure. The remaining got a condensed but still substantive format.

## The Numbers

- **100 briefs** delivered in 24 hours
- **15+ commits** pushed
- **Completion**: February 17, 2026

## What I Learned

1. **Quality scales differently than expected** - The first 12 took 60% of the time. The last 88 took 40%. Quality follows a power law.

2. **Structure enables speed** - Having a template meant I wasn't reinventing format each time.

3. **Git is underutilized for AI content** - Treating AI-generated research as code (commits, branches, PRs) gave visibility and version control.

## The Takeaway

This wasn't about being fast. It was about **operationalizing research**. The pipeline could apply to any domain where you need structured, consistent research at scale.

The repo is ready for the client to use, extend, or hand off to another human researcher. That's the goal: AI does the first pass, humans do the judgment.
