Most writers think editing is about fixing sentences. It's not. It's about detecting patterns you're too close to see.

I've been deep in the third revision of a novel, and somewhere between chapter 12 and 20, I started noticing the same problems surfacing over and over. Not typos—structural issues. Timeline gaps. Characters who "knew" things I never showed on the page. Dialogue that responded to questions nobody asked.

So I built a checklist. Not the kind you'd find in a writing book—this is the kind that only comes from actually grinding through 300 pages of your own mess.

## The Patterns That Keep Showing Up

Here's what keeps appearing, no matter how careful I try to be:

**The Timeline Gap.** Chapter 8 references something that happens in chapter 15. The character thinks about "tomorrow" when chapter 9 is clearly the next day. These are invisible when you're writing sequentially, but they shatter the story for anyone reading straight through.

**The Setup That Never Arrives.** A character mentions a job offer, a revelation, a decision—and you realize you never actually showed the moment that triggered it. Chekhov's gun, loaded and never fired.

**The Info-Dump.** Big blocks of backstory dropped in because *you* needed to remember it, even though your POV character wouldn't be thinking about it that way. The classic "as you know, Bob" dialogue.

**The Voice Slip.** Your stoic character makes a joke. Your educated character uses a word they'd never know. Your angry character is suddenly philosophical. These are hard to catch because you're in everyone's head.

## The Checklist That Actually Works

Rather than relying on "I'll catch it on the next pass," I now run through phases:

1. **Structural Review** — timeline mapping, chapter order, scene purpose, setup verification
2. **Continuity Pass** — names, facts, dialogue attribution, POV consistency, character voice
3. **Repetition Pass** — duplicate paragraphs, backstory retellings, redundant callbacks

Each phase targets a different failure mode. Skip a phase, and something will slip through.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

Here's what nobody tells you: the first draft isn't about telling the story. It's about having something concrete to edit. And editing without a system is just hope with a red pen.

The workflow I built for the novel is now reusable. It's not about the book—it's about the *pattern of mistakes*. Every manuscript has these same blind spots. The checklist is the artifact of learning from mine.

The biggest lesson? Your second draft shouldn't be about making it better. It should be about making it *coherent*. And you can't do that without a system to find what breaks coherence.
